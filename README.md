# HashiMom

HashiMom is a minimal health tracking application designed for mothers managing hypothyroidism.  
This MVP includes the following core features:

* **Lab Tracking** – record lab tests and results so you have a clear picture of your thyroid function over time.
* **Symptom Log** – capture day‑to‑day symptoms to help you and your healthcare provider spot patterns.
* **Medication Log** – track medications, doses and times to stay on top of your regimen.
* **Trend Charts** – visualize labs, symptoms and medications together to understand how they relate.
* **Gluten Snap** – upload a food photo and check for gluten content via a third‑party model.
* **Daily AI Encouragement** – receive a positive message generated by AI to help you stay motivated.

The project is structured as a mono‑repo with separate `frontend` and `backend` directories.  
All business logic lives in the backend, while the React frontend handles user interaction and display.

## Project Structure

```
hashimom/
├── backend/    # Flask + SQLAlchemy application
├── frontend/   # React + Vite + TypeScript client
├── scripts/    # Optional utility scripts (e.g. seed data)
└── README.md   # Project introduction and development guide
```

## Getting Started

This guide will walk you through setting up the project on your local machine for development.  
The backend and frontend are independent services and can be run separately.

### Backend

1. **Create a virtual environment**

   In the `backend` directory run:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   The dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run database migrations (optional)**

   For this MVP we use SQLite; the tables are created automatically on first run.  
   If you add new models, run migrations using `flask db migrate` and `flask db upgrade` after setting up Flask‑Migrate.

4. **Start the server**

   ```bash
   export FLASK_APP=app.py
   export FLASK_ENV=development
   flask run
   ```

   The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend

1. **Install dependencies**

   In the `frontend` directory run:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The client will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.  
   The development server proxies API calls to the backend.

### Scripts

The `scripts` directory can hold utility scripts such as sample data generators or deployment helpers.  
At this stage it is empty; feel free to add scripts as needed.

## Contributing

When making changes:

* Keep the architecture clean and modular.  
* Do not log any personal health information (PHI) to ensure privacy.  
* If an external API key is required, insert a `<TODO>` placeholder and document it in the code.  
* Stay within the defined MVP scope.  

## License

This project is for educational and prototyping purposes and does not include a production license.
